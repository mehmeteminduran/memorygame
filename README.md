# Udacity Front-End Web Developer - Memory Game Project
This project was made to apply the technologies that I learned from the Udacity Front-End Web Developer course.
The starter code which is a static, non-interactive version of the project has downloaded through  https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game and developed.

# Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

# How to play
- Download application or clone repository
- Right click index.html and open with browser
- flip one card over
- Turn over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
